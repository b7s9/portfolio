                <p>I am a full-stack web developer, user interface designer (UI) and user experience researcher (UX) passionate about delivering accessible interactions and experiences. Every morning, I strive to be a better <strong>listener</strong>. Every commit, every wireframe and every insight, is directly influenced by real people who need to get sh*t done.</p>
                <p>When collaborating on fast-paced projects, I utilize the design theories of Google and Microsoft as frameworks for understanding the way environmental variables correlate with content <strong>accessibility</strong>. To maximize project resources, I develop features in iterative cycles, applying simple, sustainable code whenever possible. </p>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy baking breads and desserts, making experimental electronic/vocal music, and swing dancing.</p>
