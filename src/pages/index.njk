                <p>I am a Front-End web developer, User Interface designer (UI) and User Experience researcher (UX) passionate about delivering accessible interactions and experiences that feel good. Every morning, I strive to be a better listener, so I can better serve users and meet their needs.</p>
                <p>I have experience designing dynamic apps, static sites, email blasts, and more, with companies in advertising, finance and public works. I've worked with most forms of JavaScript, including modern MVC's such as Angular, React and Vue. I'm familiar with a variety of applied social science concepts which I employ regularly in my UX research and UI designs.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy baking breads and desserts, making experimental electronic/vocal music, and swing dancing.</p>
