    <p>I designed and developed the front-end for the HELP Loan Pre-Application as a data collection tool for the Philadelphia Water Department. The Public Affairs division was looking for a way to quickly gather information on homeowners looking to replace lead pipes in their homes, so they could reduce the number of incoming phone calls, and increase the efficiency of the application process. The online form proved successful and continues to serve thousands of Philadelphians. </p>
