    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p>Todo lists are a helpful way of organizing the tasks that you need and/or want to do, but for people with ADHD/ADD, it can often be very difficult to actually find the motivation to check an item off that list. When the list gets too long, it can feel especially overwhelming.</p>
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p>One of the most effective means of self-motivation I've discovered is regular self-affirmations. By lifting your spirits, it's much easier to move that energy and apply it to something totally unrelatedâ€”like Newton's law of emotion or something.</p>
    <p>This project is a webapp that requires you to say something nice about yourself every time you want to add a new item to your todo list. Rather than view all of your todos at once in a daunting list, the todo viewer picks a random one to show you, but also picks a random affirmation to display right beneath it. This way the user experience is more focused and kinder than a standard to do list.</p>
